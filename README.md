## About the project

For my capstone, I decided to create a Life management and Family management App. Due to requirements and time, I will be presenting on the functions of my Todo List Feature. I have always wanted to create an App that I can grow with and I believe an app as diverse is this is perfect to increase my skills as a Software Engineer.
